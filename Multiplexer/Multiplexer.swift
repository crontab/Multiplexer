/**
`Multiplexer<T>` is an asynchronous, callback-based caching facility for client apps. Each multiplxer instance can manage retrieval and caching of one object of type `T: Codable`, therefore it is best to define each multiplexer instance in your app as a singleton.

For each multiplexer singleton you define a block that implements asynchronous retrieval of the object, which most of the time would be a network request, e.g. to your backend system.

A multiplexer singleton guarantees that there will only be one fetch/retrieval operation made, and that subsequently a memory-cached object will be returned to the callers of its `request()` method , unless the cached object expires according to the `timeToLive` setting (defaults to 30 minutes). Additionally, `Multiplexer` can store the object on disk - see `flush()` and also the discussion on `request(refresh:completion:)`.

Suppose you have a `UserProfile` class and a method of retrieving the current user's profile object from the backend, whose signature looks like this:

	class Backend {
		static func fetchMyProfile(completion: (Result<UserProfile, Error>) -> Void)
	}

Then an instantiation of a multiplexer singleton may look like:

	let myProfile = Multiplexer<UserProfile>(onFetch: { onResult in
		Backend.fetchMyProfile(onResult)
	})

Or even shorter:

	let myProfile = Multiplexer<UserProfile>(onFetch: Backend.fetchMyProfile)

To use `myProfile` to fetch the profile object, you call the `request(refresh:completion:)` method like so:

	myProfile.request(refresh: false) { result in
		switch result {
		case .failure(let error)
			print("Error:", error)
		case .success(let profile)
			print("My profile:", profile)
		}
	}

When called for the first time, `request(...)` calls your `onFetch` block, returns it to your completion block as `Result<T, Error>`, and also caches the result in memory. Subsequent calls to `request(...)` will return immediately with the stored object. The `refresh` parameter tells the multiplexer to try to retrieve the object again, similarly to the browser's Cmd-R function.

Most importantly, `request(...)` can handle multiple simultaneous calls and ensures only one `onFetch` operation is initiated at a time.

See also:

- `init(onFetch: @escaping (@escaping OnResult) -> Void)`
- `func request(refresh: Bool, completion: @escaping OnResult)`
- `func flush()`
- `MultiplexerMap<T>` interface

### Caching

By default, `Multiplexer<T>` can store objects as JSON files in the local cache directory. This is done by explicitly calling `flush()` on the multiplexer object, or alternatively `flushAll()` on the global repository MuxRepository if the object is registered there.

In the current implementation, the objects stored on disk can be reused only in one case: when your `onFetch` fails due to a connectivity problem. This behavior is defined in the `useCachedResultOn(error:)` class method that can be overridden in your subclass of `Multiplexer`. For the memory cache, the expiration logic is defined by the class variable `timeToLive`, which defaults to 30 minutes and can also be overridden in your subclass.

The storage method can be changed by defining a class that conforms to `Cacher`, possibly with a generic parameter for the basic object type. For example you can define your own cacher that uses CoreData, called `CDCacher<T>`, then define your new multiplexer class as:

	typealias CDMultiplexer<T: Codable> = MultiplexerBase<T, CDCacher<T>>

At run time, you can invalidate the cached object using one of the following methods:

- "Soft refresh": use the `refresh` argument in your call to `request(refresh:completion:)`: the multiplexer will attempt to fetch the object again, but will not discard the existing cached objects in memory or on disk. In case of a failure the older cached object may be used again as a result.
- "Hard refresh": call `clear()` to discard both memory and disk caches for the given object. The next call to `request(...)` will attempt to fetch the object and will fail in case of an error.

- `clear()`
- `Cacher` interface
- `MuxRepository` interface
