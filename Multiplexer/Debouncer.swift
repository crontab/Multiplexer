/// `Debouncer` triggers execution of a block after a specified delay, but in addition it can postpone the execution every time `touch()` is called. This can be useful in GUI apps when e.g. a network request should be delayed while the user types in the search field. A Debouncer instance should be retained in your GUI object to be useful, therefore beware of cyclic references that your execution block can introduce. The `touch()` method should be called at least once for the block to be executed.
/// See README.md for some examples.
